# Chaining Patterns Example

This example demonstrates different strategies for chaining agents in sequential workflows, showing how output passes between agents.

## What it demonstrates

- **ThenChain pattern**: Each agent receives only the previous agent's output as input
- **ThenAccumulate pattern**: Each agent receives original input plus all previous outputs (snowball effect)
- Comparing different chaining strategies for agent workflows

## Key concepts

- **Output chaining**: `ThenChain()` rotates context so previous output becomes current input
- **Output accumulation**: `ThenAccumulate()` builds up context with all previous outputs
- **Context management**: How data flows through sequential workflows

## Chaining Strategies

### ThenChain (Output â†’ Input)
```go
chainFlow := workflow.NewSequentialFlow("chain-pattern").
    Then(researcher).        // Gets original user input
    ThenChain(summarizer)    // Gets only researcher's output as input
```

### ThenAccumulate (Snowball Effect)  
```go
accumFlow := workflow.NewSequentialFlow("accumulate-pattern").
    Then(researcher).           // Gets original user input
    ThenAccumulate(summarizer). // Gets original input + researcher output
    ThenAccumulate(reviewer)    // Gets original + researcher + summarizer
```

## When to use each pattern

- **ThenChain**: When each step should transform the previous result (pipeline processing)
- **ThenAccumulate**: When agents need full context history (collaborative refinement)

## Running the example

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-actual-api-key-here
go run examples/workflows/chaining-patterns/main.go
```
